WHAT IS MAGPIE?
	The "Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment" (MAgPIE)
is a global land use allocation model, which is coupled to the grid-based dynamic
vegetation model LPJmL, with a spatial resolution of 0.5°x0.5°. It takes regional
economic conditions such as demand for agricultural commodities, technological
development and production costs as well as spatially explicit data on potential
crop yields, land and water constraints (from LPJmL) into account. Based on these,
the model derives specific land use patterns, yields and total costs of
agricultural production for each grid cell. The objective function of the land use
model is to minimize total cost of production for a given amount of regional food
and bioenergy demand. Regional food energy demand is defined for an exogenously
given population in 10 food energy categories, based on regional diets. Future
trends in food demand are derived from a cross-country regression analysis, based
on future scenarios on GDP and population growth.

DOCUMENTATION
	The model documentation can be found at
https://redmine.pik-potsdam.de/projects/magpie/wiki/. Please pay attentions to
the MAgPIE Coding Etiquette when you modify the code. The Coding Etiquette you
find at https://redmine.pik-potsdam.de/projects/pik-model-operations/wiki/Coding_Etiquette
The Coding Etiquette explains also the used name conventions and other
structural characteristics.

NOTES
	Besides distribution and software-as-a-service applications the source code
should also be made available in the events of model based publications or
model-based consulting.
	The name 'MAgPIE' should only be used for model versions which are either
identical to versions in the official main repository at
https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/landuse/magpie or with explicit agreement of the
copyright holder (magpie@pik-potsdam.de).

HOW TO INSTALL

HOW TO CONFIGURE
	Model run settings are set in config/default.cfg (or another config file of
the same structure). New model scenarios can be created by adding a column to
config/scenario_config.csv

HOW TO RUN
	To run the model execute "Rscript start.R" in the main folder of the model.
Make sure that the config file and scenario are set correctly before starting
the model. start.R can be also used as a template for an own, customized start
script.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
	We are interested in working with you! Just contact us through Gitlab
(https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/landuse/magpie) or by mail
(magpie@pik-potsdam.de) if you have found and/or fixed a bug, developed a new
model feature, have ideas for further model development, suggestions for
improvements or anything else. We are open to any kind of contribution. Our aim
is to develop an open, transparent and meaningful model of the agricultural land
use sector to get a better understanding of the underlying processes and
possible futures. Join us doing so!
