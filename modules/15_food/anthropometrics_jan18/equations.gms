q15_food_demand(i2,kfo) ..

                ;

*' The constraint transforms the fooduse of agricultural products into per-capita
*' food demand.
*' vm_dem_food is the fooduse of agricultural products. Its measured in tons dry matter
*' before processing. Multiplying with the nutrition attributes provides the equivalent
*' in calories. While nutrition attributes are assumed to be globally the same
*' (assumption of homogeneous products), a regional balanceflow is used to account
*' for current differences in food processing, where some regions get different calories
*' from the same fooduse quantitiy. Depending on the inputdata, the balanceflow
*' may fade out in the future, which implies actual homogeneous products.

*' The subsequent equations belong to the standalone food demand model, which is
*' executed before MAgPIE or iterated with MAgPIE. They are excluded from the run
*' of MAgPIE itself.

q15_aim ..
          v15_objective =e=
          sum(iso,v15_income_pc_real_ppp_iso(iso)
          - 10**6*v15_income_balance(iso));

*' In principle, the food demand model has only one solution which satifies all
*' equations. The objective could therefore be choosen arbirtrarily, and the
*' solver just finds the single solution.
*' However, if the model is executed outside its domain
*' (e.g. with extreme price shocks), it can happen that real income turns
*' negative (because the increase in food value exceeds the available income).
*' To avoid this case, we allow for a punishment term v15_income_balance, which
*' increases the real income, but which negatively affects the maximized
*' objective variable, disincentivizing its use in cases where not needed.


q15_budget(iso) ..

         + sum(ct,im_gdp_pc_ppp_iso(ct,iso)) + v15_income_balance(iso);

*' The budget constraint calculates the real income after an eventual price
*' shock. The basic assumption is that increasing prices reduce real income,
*' while decreasing prices increase real income.
*' Through this income effect, higher prices reduce the food demand.
*' The income before the food price shock is im_gdp_pc_ppp.
*' Its reduced by the change in value of the demanded calories under changed
*' prices.
*' In the following, the real income is used to determine food intake,
*' food demand as well as dietary composition.

            +f15_intake_regr_paras(sex,age_group,"intercept"))
         ;

*' Food intake is based on food requirement (the calories requried for a
*' normalized bodymass index under a given body height), and a regression
*' based on income which estimates how much the actual intake is relative to
*' the requried intake.

         * im_demography(ct,iso,sex,age_group))
         / sum((sex,age_group,ct), im_demography(ct,iso,sex,age_group));

*' Food demand is based on food intake and a regression
*' based on income which estimates how much the actual demand is relative to
*' the requried intake.
*' The difference between demand and intake is food waste (not explcitly
*' mentioned in this equation)

*' This equation estimates key dietary composition regression factors,
*' such as the share of animal products, empty calories, or
*' fruit vegetables and nuts. In the subsequent equations, those parameters
*' are used to determine the dietary composition using an hirachical tree:
*' Total calories are first divided into animal and plant based; the plant-based
*' are further divided into processed empty calories and nutritious calories
*' and so on.
