*' In the comparative advantage pool,the only active constraint is that the global supply is larger or equal to demand.
*' This means that production can be freely allocated globally based on comparative advantages.

*' This equation indicate The regional trade constraint for the self-sufficiency pool.
*' The share of regional demand that has to be fulfilled through the self-sufficiency pool
*' is determined by a trade balance reduction factor for each commodity `i21_trade_bal_reduction(ct)` according to the following equation @schmitz_trading_2012.
*' If the trade balance reduction equals 1, all demand enters the self-sufficiency pool.
*' If it equals 0, all demand enters the comparative advantage pool.
