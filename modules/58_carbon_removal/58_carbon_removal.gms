*' @title Carbon removal
*'
*' @description The carbon removal module intends to calculate the amount of terrestrial/land-based
*' carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and the associated costs to represent mechanisms 
*' such as the UN REDD Programme. The economic incentive for CDR is 
*' a reward (carbon price) for negative carbon emissions. These negative carbon emissions 
*' would be multiplied by the carbon price, resulting in economic incentive to reduce emissions.
*' Because the objective function of MAgPIE is the minimization of total global costs, 
*' the negative price on carbon emissions serves as incentive for the deployment of CDRs.
