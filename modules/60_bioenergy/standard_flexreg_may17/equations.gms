*' The bioenergy demand calculation for second generation bioenergy is based on
*' the following two equations from which always only one is active:
*' If $c60\_biodem\_level$ is 1 (regional) the right hand side of the first equation
*' is set to 0, if it is 0 (global) the right hand side of the second equation
*' is set to 0. In addition both equations are deactivated if $c60\_use\_bioenergy$
*' is set to 0.


q60_bioenergy_glo.. sum((kbe60,i2), vm_dem_bioen(i2,kbe60)*fm_attributes("ge",kbe60))
          =g= sum((ct,i2),i60_bioenergy_dem(ct,i2))*(1-c60_biodem_level);

q60_bioenergy_reg(i2).. sum(kbe60, vm_dem_bioen(i2,kbe60)*fm_attributes("ge",kbe60))
          =g= sum(ct,i60_bioenergy_dem(ct,i2))*c60_biodem_level;

*' Except the implementation of the switches and the fact that in the first
*' equation the bioenergy demand is summed up to a global demand both equations
*' act the same way: In both cases the equation just makes sure that the sum
*' over all second generation energy crop of the bioenergy demand is greater or
*' equal to the demand actually given by the input file $i60\_bioenergy\_dem$.
